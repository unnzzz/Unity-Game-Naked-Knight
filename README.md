# Unity-Game-Naked-Knight
This unity project is my winning submission to the Hack XR Hackathon 2022 ( Hackathon by iHub@IIT Roorkee and TechXR Innovations). This game is a point-and-click game in which the main protagonist has to successfully retrieve his/her clothes from an enchanted forest. I made the environment by using pure poly's Free Low Poly Nature Forest asset from the unity asset store, Chicken game's ultimate 2D backgrounds to make the main menu, stone golems from Dungeon Masters' Mini Legion Rock Golem Pack, and Dev Assets' Humanoid figure to include as my player. The main objective of the game is to collect the green radiation barrels before your health runs out as the golems attack you. I have included an Inventory system so as you collect armor that is spread out on the map you will see them appear in your inventory, which after equipping lowers the damage that is done to you by the enemy. I added an enemy AI system in my game to make them follow me and have also added blend trees to make the animations smoother to make the game flow much more impactful.

This game helped me bag the third position and a fellowship of Rs.50,000 in the National AR/VR Hackathon 2022 (by iHub@IIT Roorkee and TechXR Innovations) among 3500+ entries.
